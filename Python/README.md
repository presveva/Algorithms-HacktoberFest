# Factorial



In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, 
denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less 
than or equal to `n`. For example:

```
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```


# Binary Search

In computer science, binary search, [...] is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
